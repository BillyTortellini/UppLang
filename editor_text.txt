    Next Features:
     * Pointers/Dereferencing
     * Arrays
     * Structs
     * Predefine functions (print)
     * Casting
     * Strings?
     * OS-Calls/Calls to libraries (print, new/delete)
     * Bytecode Debugger
     * Backend (LLVM or C or just x64 assembly)
     * Float/Int conversion / Maybe implicit?
     * Globals

    UppLang small improvements:
     * Just highlight relevant stuff on parser errors

    Current UppLang features:
     * Expression parsing + evaluation
     * Variable definition/assignment + return
     * Primitive Type System (Int bool float)
     * Scopes
     * If-Else Flow control
     * While loop with break continue
     * Functions with parameters and return types

    Nice-to-have Features:
     * Log to window, not to console, maybe something like in a textfield
        -> Would be best with a toast like notification, and something you can focus
     * Work on GUI (Probably necessary for better debugging)

    Editor-Bugs:
     * Repeat last search does not differentiate 'f'/'t'/forward backward
     * 'r' is buggy on line end, and on empty lines
     * Undo-Redo cursor position still sucks a little (Hint: Save positions after/before command)
     * Non ASCII chars destroy some motions (Program crashes)
     * Alt-Gr spamming still cancels commands (win32 nonsense)
     * % does not jump on empty parenthesis () {}
     * O does not work on first line
     * dd with numbers seems to not take the last number
     * put with 'dd'ed lines is also a bit weird
     * CTRL-W in insert mode deletes all newlines too

    Editor features missing:
     * Correct Indentation on new line
     * Undo/Redo Tree History
     * Visual Mode
     * Visual Block/Multi-Cursor stuff
     * Command recording (@ stuff with vim, altough this could maybe be done better)
