/*  
    Up Next:
     * Fix text highlighting when scrolling right
     * Syntax highlighting for comments
     * Add more language features
     * Work on GUI (Probably necessary for better debugging)

    Bugs:
     * Repeat last search does not differentiate 'f'/'t'
     * Alt-Gr spamming still cancels commands (win32 nonsense)
     * Undo-Redo cursor position still sucks a little (Hint: Save positions after/before command)
     * Non ASCII chars destroy some motions (Program crashes)
     * 'r' is buggy on line end, and on empty lines

    Features missing:
     * Undo/Redo Tree History
     * Visual Mode
     * Visual Block/Multi-Cursor stuff
     * Command recording (@ stuff with vim, altough this could maybe be done better)

    Rendering stuff:
     * Smaller text, better distance field computation (More exact)
