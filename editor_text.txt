        Currently the AST sucks a little:
         * Token-index to AST node connection is lost
         * AST-Nodes do not have a connection back to parent
         * There is no simple way to loop over the whole AST
        Find a way to resolve all the errors
    
        For IDE it would be nice to get the symbol-table at
        any text_position.
        Meaning Text_Pos -> Token_Pos -> Ast_Node -> next_upper Symboltable
        
        Note: Currently expression have references to a symbol_table,
            but I think that with a parent pointer in AST this is not necessary

    Next Features:
     * Semantic analysis
     * Bytecode creator + interpreter
     * Pointers + Arrays 
     * Structs
     * Strings?
     * OS-Calls/Calls to libraries (print, new/delete)
     * Bytecode Debugger?
     * Backend?

    Current UppLang features:
     * Expression parsing + evaluation
     * Variable definition/assignment + return
     * Primitive Type System (Int bool float)
     * Scopes
     * If-Else Flow control
     * While loop with break continue

    Nice-to-have Features:
     * Log to window, not to console, maybe something like in a textfield
        -> Would be best with a toast like notification, and something you can focus
     * Work on GUI (Probably necessary for better debugging)

    Editor-Bugs:
     * Repeat last search does not differentiate 'f'/'t'/forward backward
     * 'r' is buggy on line end, and on empty lines
     * Undo-Redo cursor position still sucks a little (Hint: Save positions after/before command)
     * Non ASCII chars destroy some motions (Program crashes)
     * Alt-Gr spamming still cancels commands (win32 nonsense)
     * % does not jump on empty parenthesis () {}
     * O does not work on first line
     * dd with numbers seems to not take the last number
     * put with 'dd'ed lines is also a bit weird

    Editor features missing:
     * Correct Indentation on new line
     * Undo/Redo Tree History
     * Visual Mode
     * Visual Block/Multi-Cursor stuff
     * Command recording (@ stuff with vim, altough this could maybe be done better)
