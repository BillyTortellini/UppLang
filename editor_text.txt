    I personally think this is pretty good lol
    what Lol why though?
    This is almost nice now lol
    this just worked without anything wow

    Up Next:
     * g movement (gg end of file/G start/g line-number)
     * Keeping cursor indentation with k/j movements

    Bugs:
     * 'I' does not start at first character,
     * Delete inner () does not work in nested structures
     * Repeat last search does not differentiate 'f'/'t'
     * Alt-Gr spamming still cancels commands
     * Undo-Redo cursor position still sucks a little
     * Non ASCII chars destroy some motions (Program crashes)
    
    Features missing:
     * Viewport tracking
     * Undo/Redo Tree History
     * Visual Mode
     * Visual Block/Multimonitor
     * Command recording (@ stuff with vim, altough this could maybe be done better)

    Rendering stuff:
     * Blinking cursor (Knowing position what)
     * Text is still a little bit blurry
     * Display line number, relative stuff..
     * Smaller text, better distance field computation
