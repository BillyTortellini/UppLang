main :: (x:x, a:b) -> void

    return 5 + 5 * 2;
/*  
    Current UppLang features:
     * Variable definition/assignment + return

    Next Features:
     Question: Primitive datatypes as keywords (Lexer stuff)?
        -> Seems to simplify a lot of stuff
     * Type System in Interpreter (int bool)
     * Infer-Assign x := 5;
     * Flow control ! Almost requires booleans/Types

    Up Next:
     * Add basic language features (Flow-Control...)

    Nice-to-have Features:
     * Log to window, not to console, maybe something like in a textfield
        -> Would be best with a toast like notification, and something you can focus
     * Work on GUI (Probably necessary for better debugging)

    Bugs:
     * Repeat last search does not differentiate 'f'/'t'/forward backward
     * 'r' is buggy on line end, and on empty lines
     * Undo-Redo cursor position still sucks a little (Hint: Save positions after/before command)
     * Non ASCII chars destroy some motions (Program crashes)
     * Alt-Gr spamming still cancels commands (win32 nonsense)

    Editor features missing:
     * Undo/Redo Tree History
     * Visual Mode
     * Visual Block/Multi-Cursor stuff
     * Command recording (@ stuff with vim, altough this could maybe be done better)
