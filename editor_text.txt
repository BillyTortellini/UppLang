    I personally think this is pretty good lol
    what Lol why though?
    This is almost nice now lol
    this just worked without anything wow
    I actually expected this to eat performance, i do no know why

    Up Next:
     * Define text region on screen, cutoff text not in region
     * Viewport tracking (Text wrapping vertically)
     * Blinking cursor (Change cursor on almost complete commands, e.g. 'r')
     * Display line number, relative stuff.

    Bugs:
     * Repeat last search does not differentiate 'f'/'t'
     * Alt-Gr spamming still cancels commands
     * Undo-Redo cursor position still sucks a little (Hint: Save positions after/before command)
     * Non ASCII chars destroy some motions (Program crashes)
    
    Features missing:
     * Undo/Redo Tree History
     * Visual Mode
     * Visual Block/Multi-Cursor stuff
     * Command recording (@ stuff with vim, altough this could maybe be done better)

    Rendering stuff:
     * Smaller text, better distance field computation (More exact)
