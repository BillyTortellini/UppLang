# UppLang
UppLang is a combined IDE and Programming-Language currently under development by myself (Martin R).
Although my End-Goal with this project is to create a usable language as an replacement for C/C++ for other Hobby-Projects of mine, the focus of UppLang is my personal education and research.

The 3 big features I would like to (try) implementing are:
* Compile-Time Code-Execution
* Syntax-Guided IDE
* Integrated Static-Analysis (Experimental)

## Switch to another file

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

## Rename a file

You can rename the current file by clicking the file name in the navigation bar or by clicking the **Rename** button in the file explorer.
