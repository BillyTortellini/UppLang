Dion Notes:
They mentioned that they tried using a Hole-Based approach, but
having Errors is usefull. Maybe they mean the same thing that I did,
which was that Editing is easier if you can introduce Errors during changes.

Also it seemed like he was able to do a normal Copy-Paste which introduced Errors.

The Problem I tried to solve with my Syntax-Editor was to
reparse the program after inserting some new Tokens inbetween, 
which seems to be a very hard Problem, even if we have a Syntax-Driven Approach

My current Approach also was to have non Token-based editing of an AST-Tree
It looks like even Dion is still Token-Based, since they can copy-paste wrong stuff from
one Place to another

The Question is then, when does what get parsed, and when are Tree-Operations performed?

I think translating Text to AST and Back



Current Thoughts:
I don't know how to Implement a Syntax-Based Editor that allows nice editing

To be fair I feel like I currently want a Indentation-Based Syntax-Style

The 2 Brace Styles I use are:
    if cond {
        foo()
        bar()
        baz = sqrt(foo())
    }
And
    if cond 
    {
        foo()
        bar()
        baz = sqrt(foo())
    }

    if x < 5
        print("Hello")
    baz()
To be Fair I also do 
    foo(
        15, 
        32, 
        64
        what, what, what
    );

For Compilers/Error-Messages it would be great if all statements ended with a New-Line
and all Blocks ended when the indentation changes

Also, the Code editor can store the Text Hierarchically based on indentation
This would also allow for easy Folding, and the promised 'Code Level-of-Detail'

Indentation-Style
-----------------
Pros:
  - Less writing, simpler reading
  - Parenthesis Influence is limited, e.g. (), {}, [], ""
  - Better Parsing -> Better Error detection, better Auto-Completion
  - Text-Storage Better
  - Easier Editing (Since you don't need to worry about deleting {})

Indentation-Style Problems:
 - No Statements in Expressions (Lambdas)
 - Function Type vs Function Definition
 - Anonymous Blocks vs Whitespace inbetween
 - Multi-line Comments have the same problem as parenthesis
 - Multi-Line Expression
 - Copy-Pasting between Indentation-Levels
 - Changing Indentation of big blocks (Functions)
 - Strings

Things I don't like about Python-Style:
 - All statements starting a block have a Colon at the end
    while x < 5:
    if x < 5:
 - Lambdas kinda suck
 - No Multi-Line Comments, no nested comments
 - Multi-Line Expressions require \, meaning that I need to reformat a lot if I change things


 main :: () {
        if x < 5
        bar
        baz 
        boo
        foo
        fuck
        while what
            the fuck

 }


Implementation:
 - Start with Lexer + Parser
